# Work Day Scheduler

## Challenge Information

I made a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This scheduler application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I used [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.
